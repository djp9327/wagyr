Original Blackboard Submission for HW4:

Website: http://wagyr.noip.me/daily_sched
The first box is for Month (MM) and the second box is for Day (MM). This form obtains the required parameters to make a call to the SportRadar API in order to get the daily schedule for NCAA-Men's Basketball.
The return object is in json format. Although we are able to parse this json object to reveal only the relevant details, we were unable to, in the given time, display the parsed data on the web-page/front-end development. This issue will, of course, be corrected in the final version of our project.
Please see our implementation/code in our github repo here: https://github.com/ryanoflaherty/wagyr
