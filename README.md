# wagyr
A web application that facilitates multiple users to place wagers on either sporting or
custom events. It will utilize the ESPN API for live updates on many sporting events
and Venmo for peer-to-peer payments. Additionally, the application will allow the user to
create events of his/her own choices, allowing the placement of wagers on virtually
anything. We will be using two databases to support our application. The first will be
used to manage users and the second will be used to manage different wagyrs. The
four distinct states our application will present are: user dashboard (how many wagyrs
the user has won), active wagyrs, wagyrs the user can participate in (search feature),
and trending wagyr topics.
